    "name": "Three-phase method",
    "description": "The three-phase method separates the solar radiation fromthe outdoor to the indoor environments into three phases: exte-rior transport, transmission through the fenestration system andinterior transport. Each phase of energy transport is simulated inde-pendently and stored in matrix form. The resultant irradiance (orradiance, illuminance or luminance) at interior sensor points (I) isobtained by the matrix multiplication I = VTDs, where V is a viewmatrix that relates the interior sensor points with the inner BSDFpatches, T is a transmission matrix that relates the inner with theouter BSDF patches, and D is a daylight matrix that relates the outerBSDF patches with the sky patches. The final part of the equationis a vector (s) that contains the average radiance of the sky patchesfor a given time and sky condition. The combined VTD matrix cantherefore be understood as a daylight coefficient matrix that relatesoutdoor radiance with indoor irradiance.",
